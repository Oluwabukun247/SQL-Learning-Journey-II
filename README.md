# SQL-Learning-Journey-II
A collection of my SQL learning notes, projects, and experiences. This repository showcases my journey in mastering SQL, including data types, operators, and real-world applications.

## Continuing my SQL Learning Journey!

As I dive deeper into SQL, I've learned how to:

1. *Understand data types*: the building blocks of data analysis
2. *Import CSV files into SQL Server*: a crucial skill for working with data from various sources
3. *Use various operators*: including:

*SQL Operators*
- *Comparison operators*: `<`, `>`, etc.
- *Range operators*: `BETWEEN`, `NOT BETWEEN`
- *List operators*: `IN`, `NOT IN`
- *Logical operators*: `OR`, `AND`

### Unlocking Business Potential with SQL
These SQL operators can help extract actionable insights from data that drive real-world decisions, such as:

- *Uncovering hidden trends*: in customer behavior, sales data, or market shifts
- *Identifying key drivers*: of business performance and optimizing accordingly
- *Making informed decisions*: with data-backed confidence

*Real-World Application*

For instance, using SQL operators, I can analyze customer purchase history to identify trends and preferences, enabling targeted marketing campaigns that drive real results.

### SQL Data Types
To work effectively with SQL, it's essential to understand the various data types that help structure and optimize data:

- *Numeric*: INT, SMALLINT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, FLOAT
- *Text*: CHAR, VARCHAR, NVARCHAR
- *Date/Time*: DATE, TIME, DATETIME

*Tools Used*
